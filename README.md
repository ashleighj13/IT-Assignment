### My Profile

Name: Ashleigh Thompson

Student No.: s3688994

Email Address: s3688994@student.rmit.edu.au

Hi! My name is Ashleigh and I am a 32 year old university student studying a Bachelor of Business (Financial Planning) to become a Financial Adviser.

I currently work full time as a Paraplanner at a local Financial Planning firm.  This involves preparing and writing Statement of Advice documents amongst other things.  I have been in this job for 3 years and it’s the best job I’ve had so far (and I’ve had a few different jobs in real estate and bookkeeping).  I’ve finally found a career I’m passionate about.

I am married to an amazing husband and have 2 beautiful daughters, Sienna (10) and Chloe (7).  We live in a small town in tropical North Queensland, called Mackay.  I’ve lived here my entire life.  Some people know Mackay as it’s typically referred to as the gateway to the Whitsundays and Great Barrier Reef.  Cruising the Whitsundays is a definite must-do if you’re visiting the area!

We have an interesting household of our family of 4, plus 2 dogs (a Mini Dachshund and a Cane Corso Italian Mastiff), a Wheatbelt Stimson python and a goldfish.  Our weekends are generally filled with beach and camping trips, attending the kids sport (netball and gymnastics) and meeting up with friends and family.  I wish I could say I had a hobby or favourite pastime but who has time for that between all of this!!

### Interest in IT

My initial interest in computers and IT began when I was about 10 or so years old.  My parents owned a small computer store where they sold custom built computers and did repairs.  Because of this, I spent a lot of time in the shop on the computer playing games.  Back then, not a lot of people had or could even afford computers.  I was lucky enough to have heaps of access to them and it helped me develop some computer skills very early in life in regards to Microsoft Office, Explorer and simple troubleshooting issues.  This helped me when it came to my IT subjects in high school and later on in my real estate and bookkeeping jobs.

I came to RMIT as they offered a Bachelor of Business (Financial Planning) via Open Universities.  In Mackay, we have only one university nearby which does not offer this degree.  As this degree is a requirement to become a Financial Adviser, this was a good option as opposed to moving towns!

Currently, my experience is pretty limited in the wide world that is IT.  I expect to learn how IT is moulding the lives we currently live in and the ways in which it will be incorporated in our lives in the future.  I hope to learn more about how we can use IT to assist in business.
