Hi! My name is Ashleigh and I am a 32 year old university student studying a Bachelor of Business (Financial Planning) to become a Financial Adviser.

I currently work full time as a Paraplanner at a local Financial Planning firm.  This involves preparing and writing Statement of Advice documents amongst other things.  I have been in this job for 3 years and it’s the best job I’ve had so far (and I’ve had a few different jobs in real estate and bookkeeping).  I’ve finally found a career I’m passionate about.

I am married to an amazing husband and have 2 beautiful daughters, Sienna (10) and Chloe (7).  We live in a small town in tropical North Queensland, called Mackay.  I’ve lived here my entire life.  Some people know Mackay as it’s typically referred to as the gateway to the Whitsundays and Great Barrier Reef.  Cruising the Whitsundays is a definite must-do if you’re visiting the area!

We have an interesting household of our family of 4, plus 2 dogs (a Mini Dachshund and a Cane Corso Italian Mastiff), a Wheatbelt Stimson python and a goldfish.  Our weekends are generally filled with beach and camping trips, attending the kids sport (netball and gymnastics) and meeting up with friends and family.  I wish I could say I had a hobby or favourite pastime but who has time for that between all of this!!
